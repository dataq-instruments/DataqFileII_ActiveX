# DataqFileII_ActiveX
This is a project contributed by Ultimaserial. It is provided here "AS IS"

It is created on MSVC C6, kind of old, but it can provide an insight on how to read/write WinDaq files (.WDQ .WDC, and .WDH with some limitations)

To use this ActiveX, here are some pointers: https://www.ultimaserial.com/dataqfileii.html
